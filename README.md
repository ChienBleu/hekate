# Project Hekate


## Description

Our goal is to create a modular framework for a tactical-RPG game. This framework will be used in parallel for the creation of a small indie game. All the programming assets used for this framework will be open-source and under the GNU GPL licence.

Please see our [wiki](https://github.com/ChienBleu/hekate/wiki) for more information.

## Documentation

The doc is created using LDoc.
